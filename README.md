- June 8th 2025: Fangfang build the basic ODE system with identical masses and its animation but without external force

- June 8th 2025: Olivia added the case with external force (which has zero initial conditions instead)

- June 8th 2025: Fangfang added the theta-t plot

- June 9th 2025: Olivia added the descending masses case and debugged for the external force calculation

- June 11th 2025: Group meeting added the trajectory of the masses in the animation
