Log:

- June 8th 2025: Fangfang build the basic ODE system with identical masses and its animation but without external force

- June 8th 2025: Olivia added the case with external force (which has zero initial conditions instead)

- June 8th 2025: Fangfang added the theta-t plot

- June 9th 2025: Olivia added the descending masses case and debugged for the external force calculation

- June 11th 2025: Group meeting added the trajectory of the masses in the animation

- June 18th 2025: Fangfang added linearized cases

- June 24th 2025: Olivia added cases with single variable length

- June 24th 2025: Group meeting, Olivia added t-theta plot for cases with single variable length

- July 1st 2025: Olivia created plot generator for t-theta plots of the last mass in different changing period of the length
